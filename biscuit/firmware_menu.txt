Biscuit Firmware Menu (v1.0)
----------------------------

Any number you type is stored as an input.  As you type more numbers, they are
added in-place using base 10.  If you wish to zero out the current number stored,
simply hit the (z)ero key.  Many commands take a value, like (s)et.  Once the
value is copied to a setting, the current value is automatically zeroed out.

After each key press, you will see a the current value, the current channel and
the current runtime in milliseconds.
